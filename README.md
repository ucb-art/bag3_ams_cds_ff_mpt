# BAG3 workspace for cds_ff_mpt

Read the [BAG3 documentation](https://bag3-readthedocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for initial server setup instructions, and basic tutorial scripts.

## Instructions:
1. Log into to any compute server that supports RHEL7.
    - (BWRC users) All machines on the LSF cluster should now support RHEL7
2. Start bash or zsh. Note that tcsh is not supported.
3. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.
4. Initialize all submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`
5. `source .bashrc`
6. Run `./init_files.sh` to create a new cds.lib and set up symbolic links.
7. Compile the C++ back-end in pybag as follows:
    - `cd BAG_framework/pybag`
    - `./run_test.sh`
    - `cd ../..`
8. Launch `virtuoso`.
9. Run BAG commands from the bash or zsh shell.

**Note**: Steps 3, 4, and 6 only need to be done when creating a new BAG workspace.

**Note**: Step 7 needs to be done when creating a new BAG workspace or when pybag is updated.

For typical operation (i.e., with a BAG workspace that is already set up and no pybag updates), do the following:

1. Log into to any compute server that supports RHEL7
2. Start bash or zsh.
3. `cd` into the workspace
4. Update all submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`
5. `source .bashrc`
6. Launch `virtuoso`.
    - If you have a previously opened Virtuoso session in this workspace, run `load("start_bag.il")` in the CIW. This opens up the SKILL interface for BAG to import/export schematics and layouts.
    - A newly launched Virtuoso session will have this enabled already because `start_bag.il` is loaded in the `.cdsinit`.
7. Run BAG commands from the bash or zsh shell.
